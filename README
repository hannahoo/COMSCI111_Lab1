This is our lab submission for part 1c. We fixed a lot of the parsing issues that we had before.
We run the parallel processes by finding all the depdencies on a certain level of the graph,
and just execute all the commands that correspond to it.
We had a lot of trouble working with wait, and getting the child processes to return the right thing.

We added additional test cases called test-parallel.sh and test-parallel-subsh.sh, to test
the parallel cases.
